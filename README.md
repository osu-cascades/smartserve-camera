# SmartServe Camera

Smartserve v0.1 utilizes computer vision and image analyses libraries to compute the difference between images, all on a raspberry pi! The initial prototype will be used to gather data which will then be used to train a machine learning model to calculate the food waste in a restaurant setting. This project is uner active development.

## Setup

Assumptions:
- Raspberry Pi 3 model B
- Running Raspian Jessie (Raspbian Stretch will have slightly different setup steps)
